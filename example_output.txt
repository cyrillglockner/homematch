User preferences: I prefer a single-family home with a yard for outdoor activities. Being close to work and quality schools is crucial for me, preferably within a 20-minute commute. I'm looking for properties that offer at least 1,500 square feet to accommodate my family comfortably. I love modern homes with minimalist design, large windows for natural light, and energy-efficient systems. Having community amenities within walking distance is important for my lifestyle, especially parks, a gym, and a few dining options. I want to live in Brooklyn
